# Model testing April 2022

First batch of test to see if my hypothesis that the vocabulary plays a part on the efficiency of the transcription model can be verified.

The test sample is composed of 14 letters, spanning from 1920 to 1923, and that makes 43 pages in total.  
It is equally divided between letters that talks about the events of the war or something related to it and letters that talks about literally anything else, like family life or politics.

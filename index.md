Welcome to my PhD dedicated website ðŸ‘‹ !!!

In this website, you have the opportunity to read on the advancements of my thesis.  
I am documenting and sharing the experiments I am conducting to answer the question established for my PhD, and I am sometimes providing extensive results (such as tables) from the experiments.  
I am also giving summaries from the reading I did, presenting the tools I used and defining the common and difficults words/expressions I encountered during my research.

Welcome to my PhD dedicated website ðŸ‘‹ !!!

In this website, you have the opportunity to read on the various steps took during my thesis.  
I documented and shared the experiments I conducted to answer the question established for my PhD, and I sometimes provided extensive results (such as tables) from the experiments.  
I was also giving summaries from the reading I did, presenting the tools I used and defining the common and difficults words/expressions I encountered during my research.  

My thesis is now done and can be found here: [https://theses.hal.science/tel-04886481v1](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04886481v1)

THE BURGENLAND JEWS
on the
DANUBE TUG - BOAT
An Eye Witness Report
On April 16, 1938, the Jewish inhabitants of Kittsee and
Pama, Burgenland, AUSTRIA, were ejected from their homes, robbed
of what money and identity papers they had and, during the night,
marooned on some small island in the Czech section of the Danube.
On April 17, they were found by the Czech frontier guard and tak-
en to Bratislava. That very same day they were expelled from Cze-
cho-Slovakia and once again taken to the German border. On a narrow
streak, “No-man’s-land”, somewhere between the borders of Czecho-
Slovakia, Hungaria and Austria, they spent three days and nights,
in the bitter cold, half starved, and without a roof over their
heads, between the fixed bayonets of the sentries of all 3 count-
ries which they were not allowed to enter. Some of them, 17 in all,
managed to get back to Kittsee, where the old men and children were
locked up in a cellar, and the grown ups, men and women, were made
to do hard scrubbing work. Exhausted from 3 days' straying, the
poor people’s strength threatened to fail, but ruthless beating
put them to work again. During the night, after a 30 miles walk,
they were taken back to the Czech frontier.
At long last the Jews of Bratislava found a temporary way-out.
They hired a tug-boat, which landed on the Hungarian side of the
Danube, near Royka, and received the people, 68 altogether, agri-
cultural workers and merchants, infants and 80 years old men. No
country along the Danube being prepared to grant the refugees leave
on land, the Hungarian authorities extend the permit from week to
week, hoping that the Jewish organisations will secure their emigr-
ation overseas. It is now three months that these people, smitten
with despair, refused by every country, and even grudged the stay
aboard the ship – it is now three months that they are thus kept
in the vague hope of salvation.

# My PhD repository
This repository is dedicated to my PhD in digital humanities. 
As this repository is also published with Github Pages, its content can be divided in two: 
- the results of my experiments and my research
- the elements for the publication, retrieved from Jekyll and the '[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)' theme

To get access to this repository in its website format, the link is [https://flochiff.github.io/phd/](https://flochiff.github.io/phd/).

In this repository, you can find [reports](https://github.com/FloChiff/phd/tree/main/_posts) of my experiments with introduction, methodology, results and conclusions. For each experiment, you also have the possibility to obtain [additional data and results](https://github.com/FloChiff/phd/tree/main/experiments), such as graphics, tables, images, scripts and more. Finally, I also share the [readings](https://github.com/FloChiff/phd/blob/main/annexes/bibliography.md) I have done, the [words and expressions I defined](https://github.com/FloChiff/phd/blob/main/annexes/glossary.md) for more clarity and the [tools](https://github.com/FloChiff/phd/blob/main/annexes/tools.md) I frequently used for the experiments.

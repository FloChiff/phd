ISCV. ⟨[Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310645810_OCR_as_a_Service_An_Experimental_Evaluation_of_Google_Docs_OCR_Tesseract_ABBYY_FineReader_and_Transym)⟩  
In this paper, the authors present different ways to do OCR by doing an evaluation of several systems created for OCR which are Google Docs OCR, Tesseract, ABBYY FineReader and Transym. After explaining quickly what is the point of OCR, they do a rapid presentation of every system chosen and how they operate. They then applied those systems in documents related to healthcare, to see how it would worked and helped in this particular domain. Finally, they experiment on an established dataset of various documents, from noisy images to barcodes to evaluate the efficiency of the systems. In the end, they provide the statistics from this experiment, with the different options tested and the conclusion drawn from it.

In this paper, the authors present a new way to exploit the ground truth created for the training of text recognition model. After a quick history of OCR, the authors explain the operation of text recognition and the difficulties that can be encountered, helped with illustrations. They then explain the perks of working more with ground truth, without just using it for training but also sharing and documenting them so that they can be reused for other projects. The authors consequently introduce HTR-United, the project they developed from that which is a repository to store those ground trut for reuse purpose. They expose the composition of the repository and the tools developed alongside it to obtain more information from the ground truth (like metrics).

##### Eikvil, Line. “*Optical Character Recognition.*” (1993). ⟨[Link](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.3684)⟩  
This work is a complete presentation of OCR. After an introduction to present largely the concept of OCR and an history of the OCR from the moment it was developed to the time of the article production, the author breaks down the operation of OCR, step by step, using schemas to illustrate it. Then, it presents different cases of use of OCR, as well as the systems that are doing OCR and the way to evaluate it. Finally, the author explores the future of OCR, i.e. how to expand it.

In this paper, the authors explore the idea of building a model for a generation of texts : the 17th century prints. They present how they build their corpus, with information about the categories taken into account, the writing periods of different texts and their genre. They also give some precision about the quality of the images that they want, all of this being supported by illustrations and statistics. Then, they explain the rules they established for transcription, i.e. the signs that they consider and did not consider, etc. Finally, they describe their experiments and what resulted from it, which was pretty good. They present the difficulties that they will need to fix to improve the results and the future works that will be done from there.

In this paper, the authors are presenting their service platform. After introducing a bit of history behind the creation of the platform, they present the service, that works as a desktop application that needs to be downloaded and installed. Helped by illustrations and diagrams, they expose the options and tools offered by the application. They provide information about the backend, the API and the availability of the source code.

In this paper, the author presents Kraken, the OCR system he developed from OCRopus. The article breaks down the operation of the system. After presenting the interest it holds for humanities, the author explains how it works for recognition, layout analysis and script detection for different languages, with each their own specificities. This demonstration is also supported by illustrations, schemas and statistics.

In this article, the authors are presenting their platform. After exposing the reasons why they decide to launch this platform (no open source version yet and no interface that works on transcription of manuscripts), they are describing the platform: frontend and backend. They mention the options offered by eScriptorium, illustrated by examples and explain how is it working behind. They underline the fact that it is open source and finally, they present what they hope to do it the future to expand this interface.

First OCR system = 1940 ; the number of publication for HTR/OCR increased in 2002, 2007 and 2009 ; increase in the last two years ; 55 new studies between 2010 and 2017 and 55 between 2017 and 2019. Multiple languages for the studies ; 53 in English, 44 in Arabic ; 37 in Indian, etc. ; for their own works, researchers developed algorithms and techniques at smaller scales.

In this article, the authors expose the datasets they worked on to obtain models for German Fratkur and Early Modern Latin corpus. After a quick introduction on OCR, the authors presents one by one the content of each of their ground truth corpora, providing illustration of the writing mentioned and information about the number of lines for each part of the dataset. The authors also mention the specificities presented by German Fraktur for the training of a model and how to respond to it. Finally, they describe the rules they have to follow to transcribe their ground truth to help with the subsequent OCR of other corpora.
